README


Overview
This project aims to analyze gene expression and signaling pathway differences, as well as intercellular communication patterns, between glioma cells from tumor and peritumoral regions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The R code provided performs comprehensive analyses to identify key biological insights into glioma microenvironments.


Contents
The repository contains the following files:

data/: Directory containing raw scRNA-seq data and metadata.
scripts/: Directory containing R scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
results/: Directory to save analysis outputs including plots and summary tables.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Requirements
The following R packages are required to run the code:

Seurat
dplyr
ggplot2
ComplexHeatmap
CellChat
SingleCellExperiment
scater
edgeR
limma
You can install these packages using the following commands:

R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
BiocManager::install(c("Seurat", "ComplexHeatmap", "SingleCellExperiment", "scater", "edgeR", "limma"))
remotes::install_github("sqjin/CellChat")
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the scRNA-seq data.

Script: scripts/preprocess_data.R
Description: This script reads the raw data, filters cells, normalizes gene expression, and identifies highly variable genes.
Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Identify differentially expressed genes between tumor and peritumoral regions.

Script: scripts/differential_expression.R
Description: This script performs differential expression analysis using the edgeR and limma packages.
Pathway Analysis: Analyze signaling pathway differences between tumor and peritumoral cells.

Script: scripts/pathway_analysis.R
Description: This script uses pathway enrichment tools to identify significantly altered pathways.
Cell-Cell Communication Analysis: Investigate intercellular communication patterns using the CellChat package.

Script: scripts/cell_communication.R
Description: This script constructs and analyzes cell-cell communication networks to compare interactions in tumor and peritumoral regions.
Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the results of the analyses.

Script: scripts/visualization.R
Description: This script creates various plots such as heatmaps, violin plots, and cell-cell interaction networks to illustrate the findings.
Running the Analysis
To run the analysis, execute the scripts in the following order:

R
source("scripts/preprocess_data.R")
source("scripts/differential_expression.R")
source("scripts/pathway_analysis.R")
source("scripts/cell_communication.R")
source("scripts/visualization.R")
Make sure to adjust file paths and parameters as needed within each script.

Results
The results of the analysis, including differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways, and cell-cell communication networks, will be saved in the results/ directory. Key findings will be summarized in the final output files for further interpretation and manuscript preparation.
